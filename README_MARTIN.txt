wow, this took a while to do, but, all i needed to do to add another analog stick to this program was

go into Analog.cpp/.h and add another values, add it to the storage.cpp/.h
and then modify the data in /www/ so it can be used. make sure to npm run build after to compile it proper

go to builds and run make
